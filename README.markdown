#UK Search Safari Extension

As of version 5.1, Safari still doesn’t have a setting to automatically use google.co.uk (or uk.yahoo.com) for searches. This extension redirects searches from Google.com to Google.co.uk, and from search.yahoo.com to uk.search.yahoo.com.

It doesn’t do anything else, there are no settings and it’s free.

##Installing UK Search (Mac)

Download the latest version from the [downloads page][downloads]. Once downloaded, double-click the extension, or drag to the Safari icon in your dock.

##Uninstalling UK Search (Mac)

Choose Safari > Preferences… from the menu, click on the extensions tab (blue puzzle piece icon), select "UK Search" from the menu on the left, click the 'Uninstall' button.
